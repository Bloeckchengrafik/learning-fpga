# learning-fpga

Hi, I'm Chris and I just got my first FPGA Development Board (Tang Nano 9k) and I'm excited to learn how to use it. I'm going to document my first steps and resources that I found useful here.

Note: I'm not a professional, I'm just a hobbyist. If you see any mistakes or have any suggestions, please let me know.

## Toolchain

See the dockeredToolchain folder for a docker image that contains the open source toolchain for my board.
I built it because it's a pain to install the toolchain everywhere I want to use it (I use multiple computers and like to distro hop).

Also see the examples folder for a little counter with pause and reset buttons (one of the first things I did with the board).
